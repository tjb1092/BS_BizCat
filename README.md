# BS_BizCat

This is the first major static website I've built using the Bootstrap 4 framework, HTML5, and JQuery.

### Shout out to Traversy Media for the guidance.
I was forced to review the Bootstrap documentation and figure out how to implement custom backgrounds, cards, etc. in addition to adding some cats to the theme it. Yarn was used as the front-end package manager. It was a good learning experience!
